# URL Shortening Application

## Functional Requirements
A user can enter a URL and get the shortened version of it.

## Technical Requirements
 - Simple frontend that allows the user to input a URL and get the shortened version of it
using a front-end framework (preferably React).
 - Dockerized application that exposes required API (ideally, GraphQL)
 - Implement a/b test 30/70 between external API (https://dev.bitly.com/) and your own
algorithm implementation for the URL shortening
 - Application should be covered with tests
 - It should have clear guidelines on how to run it
 - It should be published on GitHub or a similar platform

The rest of the implementation details are up to you.
